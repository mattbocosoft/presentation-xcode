When a build is ready to be distributed to some audience, it must be archived through Xcode. It is important to build and archive your app through a legitimate version of Xcode that was downloaded from the official Apple Developer's website instead of a mirror, otherwise you could be [introducing security concerns](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=09222015a).
