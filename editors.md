#Source Code Editors

The Editors segment control resides on the top right corner of the Xcode window, to the left of the panel segment control. This three-button segment allows developers to change between three different 'modes' of editing, which will be covered below. Additional options for each of the three buttons are available by clicking and *holding* on each button.  

###Standard Editor  
The standard editor is what many developers spend most of their time using. The Standard Editor consists of a single file opened at a time in the Source Editor area. The lack of additional views or contextual information makes this the fastest editor to work with.  

###Assistant Editor
When working with both the header and implementation files of a class, it is common to use the Assistant Editor to view both files at the same time, side-by-side. Another common use case is viewing an Interface Builder file along with the Nib owner source code simultaneously for quick and easy cross-referencing and outlet connections.  

Each view in the Assitant Editor owns its own portion of the Jump bar at the top of the Editor area. The root level menu on the Jump Bar offers manual selection of a file, as well as automatic suggestions to provide the developer with the most likely related files and counter-parts.

The additional options accessible by clicking and holding on the Assistant Editor button enables the developer to present the editors using different layouts (i.e. horizontal vs vertical stacking).
