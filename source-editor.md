#Source Editor

The source editor is where developers spend most of their time. This window is used for writing code, setting break-points, browsing classes and resources.  

Xcode uses text color-coding in order to convey what words in the code represent (e.g. Class Names, Comments, Constants, Function Names, etc.).

###Preferences
Source editor features (e.g. line numbers) can be customized in Xcode Preferences (âŒ˜+Comma) under the "Text Editing" tab.

###Code Completion
While typing in Xcode, it's easy to type the names of symbols (e.g. methods, variables, classes, etc.) using code completion. Code completion allows developers to type just a few characters before Xcode shows a list of likely code completion matches for what is being typed. The developer can then either use the computer mouse or the arrow keys to highlight the desired code completion option, and then hit enter or tab to select it.

It's important to learn how to take advantage of short-cuts like code completion and keyboard shortcuts in order to speed up your workflow.
